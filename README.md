# Hello-world üåç 

My first repository (hello world!).

For the sake of tradition, it's a repo for all my "hello-world" codes.

I will put a hello world for any language I can code in here...Or for any language I just like
 
And if you want to see those print you a hello world (for whatever reason) 

you can use any online editor/IDE like those:

- [Replit](https://repl.it)
