# hello-world
my first repository (hello world). A repository for all my "hello worlds", 
in any language i can code in. this repo is my starting point on github (tutorial).
 For the sake  of tradition...Its a repo for all my "hello-world" codes.
 I will put a hello world for any language I know here.
